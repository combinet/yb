     a central theme when i when i think about your work and your research
for me is this idea of hormesis and
the survival signals we put on the body and i wonder if at the start of this
conversation you can outline what hormesis is
and why is so important when we come to think about aging
well the problem is we've built a world that's
that's very comfortable and we were not we did not evolve in
these conditions we are meant to be typically
cold and hungry and in response to those adverse cities
our bodies fight back and so what the pro the problem is that we now sit in
chairs we eat as much food as we want we don't have to walk anywhere or lift
anything heavy and our bodies become complacent
now what was discovered is you need hormesis what's that that basically
means the what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
and so what we do when we exercise and what if we skip a meal
what we're doing is inducing this very ancient very very ancient billions of
years ancient mechanism that protects our body against decay
disease uh and the root causes of aging
in an effort to survive uh and so you really want to do the
opposite of what modern life gives you yeah
one of the things that you recommend i guess one of the most easy to
understand and simplest interventions you recommend for people is to eat less
and i think that fits quite beautifully into this uh idea of
hormesis it doesn't stay in terms of what eating less signals to the body
and then what it causes the body to do afterwards so i wonder if we could just
sort of dive in there into why is eating less important what signal
does it give us and then how does that impact
the way in which we age well there are three main longevity
mechanisms that we know of um they have certain names one's called certains
there's seven of those genes in our body and we've been working on them for 25
years another one's called mtor the other one's called ampk
the names don't matter as much as the fact that they're activated by
by a bit of hunger to give you an example in 2005 we we
published a science paper that showed uh which at the time was revolutionary
now it's just considered obvious but one of these sort of genes called
certainty one was activated by
caloric restrictions so we found that animals that had been eating less and
had low levels of insulin and another factor that's related called igf-1
insulin related growth factor uh that boosted the levels dramatically
of this cert one protective longevity gene
and then we showed that protects against dna damage
and so what we do when we're hungry uh skip a meal or two which is what i do
every day uh it boosts up our longevity genes and
they take care of us we know that if we boost the longevity
genes in animals they live longer they're healthier they stay
fitter for longer and they die much quicker at the end of life
and you know i think everybody would know that in in human history
fasting is considered one of the healthiest things you can do
um and so there's so much evidence that it's really incontrovertible that
skipping meals is not only good for you but will make
you live longer
there's many ways of course to skip meals
you know how do you view fasting because there's you know
all different types of intermittent fasting uh protocols out there
uh there is time restricted eating which i know uh sachin panda has done a lot of
the research on at the salk institute and
you know i think it's quite a confusing area for people coming to it's fresh
specifically through your lens of looking at longevity and how to delay or
even prevent aging or well we'll come to it later even reverse aging you know how
do you look at foods um
and how we can practically you know do this in our own lives
yeah well there was an incredible study that
um was that of the nih uh in bethesda a
good friend of mine rafael de cabo and his lab had over 10 000 mice they
put them on different diets different carbs
protein fat and they then divided those diets into
two groups some mice got food all the time
and they nibbled on it during the day and then the others
got the meal once i think it was for an hour only and those my gorge themselves
and ate almost as much as the ones that were grazing
and it didn't matter what the food was it was the ones that ate in that window
that lived dramatically longer so if you can extrapolate and there's
always caveats but i think the principle still holds
in our cells which is it's not as much about what you're
eating but when you're eating and it is confusing because first of all
we're all different we have different levels of willpower we have different
jobs some of us are hungry in the morning some are
hungry at night um some of us can go for three days i
can't but some people can some can go for just
the morning plus we're all genetically different
we'll have different microbiomes and food preferences so it is complicated
but i i found it relatively simple to explain it this way
if you are not starving at breakfast and you
prefer dinner skip breakfast
and if you can do without dinner skip dinner but skip one of those too because
then you have a whole period of sleep that
means you're fasting and your body will protect itself and repair itself better
now you can take it one step further if your game
uh and that's what i did over the last um
18 months during the pandemic was to also as best i can skip lunch as
well so i go all day without eating
with a tiny little bit of yogurt in the morning to dissolve a supplement
but essentially i'm just here i'm holding a glass of water
i'll have tea i love coffee that'll keep me full
um and i go till dinner and at dinner i have a reasonable meal i'll go out to a
restaurant and i'll eat something and try not to be full i don't stuff myself
because i'll actually sleep poorly but i i
really enjoy that and first of all it saves money second of all it makes
you enjoy food a lot more and third there's a misconception that you'll feel
tired it's totally wrong if you can get
through three to four weeks of that with some willpower and uh
and a bit of uh hot beverage if you hot beverages you'll actually get
your body will get accustomed to it to the point where eating lunch feels weird
and you definitely don't need it you definitely don't feel tired and i don't
get that afternoon slump which i know is caused by a decrease in insulin after a
lunchtime meal and i've never felt better i've never
looked better i've never had so much energy physically and mentally
it's fascinating when we think about this through an evolutionary
lens that you know of course why why would we be
struggling mentally when we were hungry because of course
if we really were hungry in the past we would need our
you know our mental acuity right as as good as it could be to go and actually
fix that problem get out there find some food hunt so
it really makes sense but also it also makes me think of what you said
right at the start of our conversation about modern life being too comfortable
because you know what i'm in my early 40s i
remember from a young age you know even though i'm from an indian family i saw
my mum practice various forms of fasting once
or twice a week but we never did you know for us it was
get up as soon as you're up eat your breakfast you know
eat eat eat was the message i got as a kids and i think that's the message a
lot of society gets so when you talk about
eating less or reducing how often you eat could
potentially give you short-term health benefits but
also long-term health benefits and delay aging
i think it's quite revolutionary for a lot of people to hear these days
well intermittent fasting now is the most popular diet in the world and
hopefully it's not a fad because this is probably the most effective diet that's
ever been promoted in the on the planet
um even for children i'm not suggesting malnutrition or starvation by any means
but having three meals a day plus snacks
uh is a calorie overload for even for children in the most cases you can tell
just by the amount of fat a kid is carrying as to whether you're over
feeding your kid and if you're if you have an
obese child and i know it's very difficult because in my family we
struggle with this as well but the effects on that child will echo
for decades perhaps even towards the end of life they will still have the
memory the epigenetic memory we call it of having
been obese as a child and so one area that i'm researching and going to be
communicating about is the effects of our lifestyle
not just on adults and the elderly but even on children
yeah i want to come back to that shortly um
but before we leave the topic of eating less
you said intermittent fasting is the most popular diet or way of eating in
the world now and you know there's brand new blog
posts podcasts youtube videos every day coming out on this
um do you think of intermittent fasting as
different to time restricted eating and the reason i'm sort of diving in here is
you know when i see patients i have to be
very clear with what i'm asking them to do you know very specific so they really
understand what i'm recommending and i think
for some people intermittent fasting is one meal a day for some people it's you
know 16 hours without eating and eight hours a day where i'm consuming food
then you also have time restricted eating where it's eat all your food
within an eight-hour winner or a 10-hour winner or a 12-hour window and i think
there is a little bit of confusion out there as to what these terms actually
mean so how do you put that together for people uh if they're asking
oh i i i don't think that it's helpful to have
these all these different names it's essentially just eat less often that's
how simple it is skip a meal skip the snacks
um so intermittent fasting time restricted feeding
to me it's all the same thing it's just uh
don't keep your body filled with food that's
pretty simple um the amount of hours
the more you can spread it out so 18 for me is is a good good number
um 16 is okay you know i i eat within two hours so i
get basically 22 hours which works for me
um but here's the the really important point
um it's not complicated you do what you can
you start skipping meals start with one dinner or breakfast
and then if you can do that then try to go longer
it's not the other really important thing is if
you try to do what i do from a standing start you will fail
there's no question it's too hard your body will freak out it'll feel tired
your brain will be distracted uh and you'll go straight to the fridge
you need to give yourself time it can take a month to get there and one of the
adaptations is your liver needs to learn to put out glucose to maintain steady
levels so it's not like this through the day
and and that takes it takes a while but once you're at the state that i'm in
and your microbiome is optimized and your liver is very happy with its
existence then you you will
find it very hard to go back to eating the old way um and you also
generally look a lot better as well which is a nice side effect if you
enjoyed that clip here's another powerful clip that i think you are
really going to enjoy walking lots materially affects the volume of the
hippocampal formation it gets bigger as the result of exercise and the functions
it supports get better in a very important sense
you've reversed the functional aging of the brain
